## The Challenge: Suboptimal DEX Routing

Current Solana DEX aggregators often fail to capture the best token swap routes in real-time, leading to:
- Suboptimal slippage
- Missed liquidity opportunities
- Inconsistent pricing during high volatility
- Delayed execution and higher costs

<Note>
These inefficiencies particularly impact traders during crucial market moments when optimal routing matters most.
