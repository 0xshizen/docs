## The Challenge: Unreliable Transaction Landing

In the Solana ecosystem, transaction confirmation times can be unpredictable due to:
- Block congestion during peak periods
- Lack of transaction prioritization
- Network latency and validator distribution
- Varying infrastructure quality

<Note>
This uncertainty particularly affects power users like traders, bots, and dApps where timing is critical.
</Note>

## Our Solution: Stake-Enabled, Multi-Path Submission

Stellium uses staked connections and automatically submits transactions to validator leaders through our global low-latency endpoints. We compete at the shred level for optimal performance.

-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": $UUID,
    "method": "sendTransaction",

        "<base64_encoded_tx>",

## Transaction Tip 

Each transaction must include a system transfer instruction to one of the Stellium tip addresses below, with a minimum tip of 0.001 SOL. To ensure optimal transaction landing, we recommend alternating addresses for each transaction.

Stellium Tip Address:

```bash
ste11XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1
ste11XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX2
ste11XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX3
```

Beta launch of fast transaction landing is coming soon.
