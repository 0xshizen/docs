## The Challenge: Unreliable Transaction Landing

In the Solana ecosystem, transaction landing rate and finality times can be unsatisfying due to:

- Blockchain congestion during peak periods
- Lack of transaction prioritization
- Network latency and validator distribution
- Varying infrastructure quality

<Note>
  This uncertainty particularly affects power users like traders, bots, and
  dApps where execution quality and consistency is critical.
</Note>

## Our Solution: Stake-Enabled, Multi-Path Submission

Stellium uses staked connections and automatically submits transactions to validator leaders through our low latency networks.
Stellium optimizes the whole newtorking stack to improve landing rate and tx finality times.

## API Usage

We use the standard Solana `sendTransaction` format in our API (coming soon):

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://STELLIUM_ENDPOINT?api-key=$APIKEY' \
-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": $UUID,
    "method": "sendTransaction",
    "params": [
        "<base64_encoded_tx>",
        { "encoding": "base64" }
    ]
}'
```

## Transaction Tip

Each transaction must include a system transfer instruction to one of the Stellium tip addresses below, with a minimum tip of 0.001 SOL.
To ensure optimal transaction landing, we recommend alternating addresses for each transaction.

Stellium Tip Address:

```bash
ste11XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1
ste11XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX2
ste11XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX3
```

<Note>Beta launch of fast transaction landing is coming soon.</Note>
