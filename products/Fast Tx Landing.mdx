## The Challenge: Unreliable Transaction Landing

In the Solana ecosystem, transaction confirmation times can be unpredictable due to:
- Block congestion during peak periods
- Lack of transaction prioritization
- Network latency and validator distribution
- Varying infrastructure quality

<Note>
This uncertainty particularly affects power users like traders, bots, and dApps where timing is critical.
</Note>
