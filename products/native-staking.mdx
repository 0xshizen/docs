## The Challenge

Many Solana delegators miss out on potential yields due to:
- High commission rates
- Value leakage from blind arbitrage/tip escape from sophisticated searchers
- Suboptimal block assembly
- Poor performance/DevOps

Centralisation risk.


## Our Solution

Stellium Engine maximizes the value capture. Start from native staking. No custodial risks and smart contract risks.

By staking with Stellium validator, users also contribute to network decentralization and better transaction landing experience powered by staked connection.
