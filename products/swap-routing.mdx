## The Challenge: Current Aggregators Fall Short in Today's Fast-Moving Markets

With new tokens and pools launching on Solana daily — many of which account for up to **two-thirds of the chain's trading volume** — timely and efficient routing is critical for serious traders.

Yet, current DEX aggregators struggle to keep up. They often fail in **token discovery** and **route optimization**, resulting in:

- No routes found immediately after token launches  
- Bad prices
- Delayed or failed execution
- High integration costs for dApps
- Complicated fee settings

<Note>
These inefficiencies hit hardest during high-volatility windows — precisely when execution quality matters most.
