## The Challenge: Suboptimal Validator Returns

Many Solana delegators miss out on potential yields due to:
- Unoptimized validator selection
- Missed MEV opportunities
- High commission rates
- Poor validator performance

<Note>
The difference between average and optimized staking can represent significant lost yield over time.
