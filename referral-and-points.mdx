## Overview

At Stellium, we believe in rewarding our community. For native staking, you are getting highest yield with 0% inflation commission and 0% MEV commission. Beyond this, you can earn even more through our referral program and points system. When you invite friends to stake together, both of you can earn between 20-50% of the block rewards that referees contribute. Additionally, every interaction earns you valuable Stellium Points, opening up exciting possibilities within our ecosystem.

<Tip>
The more stake you invite and the longer you stake, the more rewards and points you'll earn!
</Tip>

## Referral Program

### Minimum Requirements

To participate in the referral program, users must stake a minimum of 0.1 SOL

<Warning>
You cannot use your own referral code to earn rewards.
</Warning>

### Tiered Benefits

Your earning potential grows with your total stake. Here's how the tiers work:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Total Staked" icon="coins">
    Refers to the total amount of SOL you and your friends have staked in Stellium
  </Card>
  <Card title="Total Commission" icon="percent">
    The percentage of referee block rewards you earn together
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Tier | Total Staked (SOL) | Total Commission | Custom Referral Code |
|------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 0.1              | 20%        | ❌                  |
| 2    | 100              | 25%        | ✅                  |
| 3    | 300              | 30%        | ✅                  |
| 4    | 1,000            | 35%        | ✅                  |
| 5    | 10,000            | 40%        | ✅                  |
| 6    | 50,000           | 45%        | ✅                  |

<Note>
Higher tiers not only earn more commission but also unlock the ability to customize your referral code, making it more memorable for your network.

### Important Rules to Note

#### Active Stake and Tier Calculation
- Only **active stake** counts towards your tier calculation
- Tier changes may take up to 1 epoch to reflect as your stake becomes active
- Reward calculations are performed on a per-epoch basis

#### Tier Upgrades and Commission Updates

When you upgrade to a higher tier:
- Your new tier benefits take effect from the current epoch
- You can immediately update commission rates for existing referral codes
- Changes to commission rates apply from the current epoch forward



## Stellium Points

Stellium Points are our way of recognizing and rewarding active participation in our ecosystem. Points are earned alongside your staking rewards and referral commissions, creating an additional layer of benefits for our community.

#### Points Boost System
Both referrers and referees can earn boosted points based on:
- Staking duration (longer staking = more points)
- Stake amount (higher stakes = more points)
- The boost applies to both parties, and it encourages long-term participation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Duration" icon="clock">
    Earn more points the longer you maintain your stake
  </Card>
  <Card title="Amount" icon="chart-line">
    Higher stake amounts multiply your points earning potential
  </Card>
</CardGroup> 


<Warning>
Any attempt to manipulate the referral system or points earning will result in the loss of rewards and points.
