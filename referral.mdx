## Earn Together

Stellium's referral program allows both referrers and referees to earn additional rewards together. These rewards come on top of our already competitive 0% commission and 0% MEV commission structure. As a referrer, you can earn between 20-50% of the block rewards that your referees contribute.

But that's not all - you'll also earn Stellium Points alongside your staking rewards. These exclusive points open up exciting possibilities within the Stellium ecosystem, rewarding active participants in our community.

<Tip>
The more friends you invite and the more they stake, the more rewards and Stellium Points you'll earn!

## Program Rules

### Minimum Requirements

To participate in the referral program, users must:
- Stake a minimum of 0.1 SOL
- Generate their unique referral link after meeting the minimum stake requirement

### Tiered Benefits

Your earning potential grows with your total stake. Here's how the tiers work:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Total Staked" icon="coins">
    Refers to the total amount of SOL you have staked in Stellium
  </Card>
  <Card title="Commission" icon="percentage">
    The percentage of referee block rewards you earn
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Tier | Total Staked (SOL) | Commission | Custom Referral Code |
|------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 0.1              | 20%        | ❌                  |
| 2    | 100              | 25%        | ✅                  |

| 5    | 3,000            | 40%        | ✅                  |
| 6    | 10,000           | 45%        | ✅                  |

<Note>
Higher tiers not only earn more commission but also unlock the ability to customize your referral code, making it more memorable for your network.

### Important Rules to Note

#### Active Stake and Tier Calculation
- Only **active stake** counts towards your tier calculation
- Tier changes may take up to 1 epoch to reflect as your stake becomes active
- Reward calculations are performed on a per-epoch basis

#### Tier Upgrades and Commission Updates
<Warning>
You cannot use your own referral code to earn rewards.
</Warning>

When you upgrade to a higher tier:
- Your new tier benefits take effect from the current epoch
- You can immediately update commission rates for existing referral codes
- Changes to commission rates apply from the current epoch forward

#### Points Boost System
Both referrers and referees can earn bonus points based on:
- Staking duration (longer staking = more points)
- Stake amount (higher stakes = more points)
- The boost applies to both parties, encouraging long-term participation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Duration Boost" icon="clock">
    Earn more points the longer you maintain your stake
  </Card>
  <Card title="Amount Boost" icon="chart-line">
    Higher stake amounts multiply your points earning potential
  </Card>
