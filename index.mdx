## Stellium: Where Stars Align for Solana

In astrology, a stellium is a rare alignment of multiple celestial bodies in a single sign—an event that channels immense focus and energy into a single point in the sky. We built Stellium with the same philosophy.

On Solana, fragmented infrastructure often forces traders, builders, and delegators to navigate complexity: suboptimal routing, inconsistent transaction speed, and diluted validator yields. At Stellium, we unify all of it. From best routing to low-latency transaction execution, and optimized validator performance — every piece is aligned.
